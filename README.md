# Analytics Page Task
One of the basic components to consume large amounts of information is a table. This helps users to get anidea of different
metrics for their perspective. Your goal for this assessment is to create a customisable table with a set of functionalities. The table
that you will create will feature an analytics page that will call aREST API to fetch the data. That data needs to be represented on
your Table component and enable the user to perform some operations that will alter the view for the end user

# App Features
-> You need to give an option for the user to input the dates as a Date Picker to call the API end point to fetch data. Please
note that the data would be available for a sample range only (Try 1-Jun-2021 to 31-Jun-2021)
* Reusable Analytics Table Component
* Allow the user to enable/hide a particular column from view The columns for the table need to have a
representation separately as well. This will allow the user to select/deselect a particularcolumn from view
* Reorderable table columns (from settings tab [refer mock]).
* Data formatting (each cell).
* Sortings & filters.
* Responsive Table.- Extra
[OPTIONAL] Reusable data cache layer. (Don't call http call again if the data has been queried recently.)
-> Shareable table link (If you share the link to anyone, table's all filters & columns should be populated)

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
